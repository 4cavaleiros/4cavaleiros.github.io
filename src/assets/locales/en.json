  "about.column1": "The 4Cavaleiros drama begins when Baal, a creature from Hell, decides to bring the Apocalypse to Earth, before the agreement between Paradise and Hell (In this case Paradise won in Rock Paper Scissors from Hell and decided to leave the Apocalypse for another millennium). When Baal is on his daily rest, nothing can disturb him, not even a little imp, and that's when things start to go wrong: Baal is relaxed sitting in his hellish beach chair (which already comes with a massager) stretching his goat legs and drinking a glass of angel tears (The rarest drink in hell). Baal thinks what he's gonna do the next day: whip some goblins for fun? Killing time burning some bad souls?",
  "about.column2": "He hasn't decided yet. After resting for few hours (as if needed), Baal decides to check his profile on FaceHell (The biggest infernal social media) and at this moment, Baal visualizes an image marked with his name: “HUEHUEHUE, Baal Infernus”, and notice that someone edited his face and the body of an international singer well known on earth, called Just .. (he knew the name). To improve it, some comments were published: “Baal Infernus”, BABY BABY BABY, OOOH! ” and “Baal Infernus, we are BAALIBERS! HUEHUEHUEHUE.",
